        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://www.eastdelta.edu.bd/">East Delta University.</a> As a third-year undergraduate student, I am particularly interested in various concepts of computer science, especially those that involve practical applications, such as CSE labs and EEE projects.
           <br/> Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy exploring new skills. Currently, I am delving into web development and continuously learning new things every day.
           <br/> I believe I am a hardworking individual, always ready to take on challenges within or beyond my capabilities.
